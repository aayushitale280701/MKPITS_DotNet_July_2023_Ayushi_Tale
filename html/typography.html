        <p class="text-left">Left aligned text.Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, 
            readable and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line 
            lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, as well as adjusting the space between pairs of letters. The term 
            typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created 
            by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not 
            design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as an
            ornamental and decorative device, unrelated to the communication of information.</p><br><br><br>
