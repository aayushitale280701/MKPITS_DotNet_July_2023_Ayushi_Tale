            learn how to use CSS float positioning, as well as some of the pitfalls when using it.

            Newbies to CSS usually have a difficult time grasping how float positioning works. This is probably because people tend to overuse it, 
            or many times theyâ€™re using a CSS framework that uses it waaaay too much (lookinâ€™ at you Bootstrap v2 ðŸ‘€).

            Using float too often can make page layouts unpredictable and prone to breaking. 
            After teaching a bunch of people how to use float, Iâ€™ve come up with 3 rules/guidelines 
            to easily understand float.
