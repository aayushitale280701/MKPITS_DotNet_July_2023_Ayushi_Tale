                   <p style="width:500px;"> A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller
                 than a lake. A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, 
                 including water gardens designed
                  for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar
                   ponds designed to store thermal energy.
                   Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams 
                   are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess
                    thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.
                 These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as 
                 stream pools and tide pools.</p>
